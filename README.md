# Catalogue single page application
This project is a semi completed store based on a catalogue of products. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of React and Redux to build a  a catalogue, that is, a browsable list of items that you can filter and access to by details.

# Live link

check console for catched fetch errors.
You can always start a local server with the steps below!
